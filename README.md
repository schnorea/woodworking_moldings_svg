# woodworking_moldings_svg
Profiles for wood trimwork moldings in SVG format.  Great for extruding modlings in OpenSCAD and Blender

Clicking on the svg files in svgs folder to view them in Github will be disappointing.  They are just the outside profiles and aren't filled.

To see the molding try those in the svgs_color_fill.
